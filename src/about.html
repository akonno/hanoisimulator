                    The Tower of Hanoi [...] is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
                        <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.</li>
                        <li>No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.</li>
                    </ol>

                    The Tower of Hanoi consists of three pillars and multiple discs. The pillars are named A, B, and C, from left to right. Initially, all the discs are placed on pillar A.

                <p class="content">
                    The instructions for moving the discs are simple. Write one line of instruction to move a disc once. To move the top disc from pillar A to the top of pillar B, write "A,B." For moving the top disc from pillar B to the top of pillar C, write "B,C." By entering these instructions in the "Motion commands" text area, you can specify the movements of the discs.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    After completing the instruction entry, click the "Run commands" button to initiate the animation (this button will then change to the "Pause" button). Alternatively, you can start the animation by clicking on the Tower of Hanoi screen. To pause the animation, either click the "Pause" button or click on the animation screen once more.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    When the animation is paused, you can save a screenshot of the animation screen by pressing the "Take screenshot" button.
