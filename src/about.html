                <p>
                In this simulator, you are expected to <strong>prepare a sequence of move
                commands yourself</strong> and execute them to check whether your solution is correct.
                The simulator does not automatically solve the puzzle.

                If the Tower of Hanoi has already been explained in class, you may skip the

                    The Tower of Hanoi [...] is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>
                        <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.</li>
                        <li>No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.</li>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Usage: Run move commands</h2>

            <p>
            The Tower of Hanoi consists of three pillars and multiple discs.
            The pillars are named A, B, and C from left to right.
            Initially, all discs are placed on pillar A.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/img/screen-en.png" alt="[Simulator Screen]" />

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Move command format</h3>

            <p>
            Write <strong>one move per line</strong>.
            Each line specifies how to move the <em>top disc</em> from one pillar to another.
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Format:</strong> <code>A,B</code> (move the top disc from A to B)</li>
            <li><strong>Another example:</strong> <code>B,C</code></li>
            <li>Uppercase / lowercase letters are both accepted.</li>
            <li>Spaces around letters and commas are allowed.</li>
            <li><strong>Empty or blank lines are not allowed</strong> and will result in an error.</li>
            <li>Text after <code>#</code> is treated as a comment.</li>
            <li><strong>Trailing commas are not allowed</strong> (e.g. <code>A,B,</code> is invalid).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            Note: You can also use <code>1,2,3</code> instead of <code>A,B,C</code>.
            This is optional; using <code>A,B,C</code> is recommended for clarity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Running the simulation</h3>

            <ul>
            <li>
                Click <strong>Run Simulation</strong> to start the simulation.
                If an error is found, the button turns red and shows
                <strong>Move until error</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click <strong>Move until error</strong> to run the simulation
                up to the point where the error occurs.
                The error line and its type are displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also start or pause the simulation by clicking
                directly on the Tower of Hanoi screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the simulation is paused, click
                <strong>Take screenshot</strong> to save the current view.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            The text area initially contains a small example (3 discs) for demonstration.
            Replace it with the output generated by your own program.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Settings</h3>
            <p>
            The simulator provides a Settings menu (top right) where you can adjust:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the number of discs (default: 7)</li>
                <li>the screen theme (light / dark / system)</li>
                <li>the display language (English / Japanese)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Please follow your instructor’s instructions when changing these settings.
