                    This simulator runs move commands and visualizes the result; it does not solve the puzzle. Students generate commands with their own programs, and instructors verify correctness visually.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Purpose and classroom usage</h2>

            <p>
                This simulator is designed for programming courses where students
                generate a sequence of move commands for the Tower of Hanoi using
                their own programs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The simulator <strong>does not solve the puzzle automatically</strong>.
                Instead, it executes student-generated commands and visualizes the result,
                allowing instructors to verify correctness efficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
                In typical classroom use, students paste their command output into the simulator,
                and instructors confirm the result visually (e.g., by checking the final state
                on screen or a submitted screenshot).
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Typical classroom usage</h2>
            <p>
            This section describes common instructional patterns when using the simulator in programming courses.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Baseline task:</strong> Use 7 discs as the standard requirement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bonus / advanced task:</strong> Encourage students to try
                8 or more discs for additional credit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Optional challenge:</strong> Allow highly motivated students
                to attempt up to 10 discs, with appropriate time considerations.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Because the required number of moves grows exponentially,
            simulations with a larger number of discs may take a long time to complete.
            In one reference environment, transferring 7 discs required over 6 minutes,
            while 10 discs required more than 50 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            In classroom settings, instructors may verify submissions by checking that the simulation runs without errors and reaches the correct final configuration (often via a screenshot), rather than waiting for the full animation to finish in real time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Difficulty control (number of discs)</h2>

            <p>
            The difficulty of the Tower of Hanoi task can be adjusted by changing
            the number of discs. Increasing the number of discs significantly
            increases the number of required moves.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Changing the number of discs</h3>

            <p>
            The number of discs can be changed from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu
            (top right of the simulator screen).
            The available range is from <strong>5 to 10 discs</strong>,
            with <strong>7 discs</strong> as the default.
            </p>

            <p>
            This allows instructors to control the task difficulty without changing
            the assignment itself.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-6">Advanced: Using URL parameters</h3>

            <p>
            As an alternative, the number of discs can also be specified
            using the <code>numDiscs</code> URL parameter.
            This may be useful when distributing fixed links to students.
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=5">5 discs</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=6">6 discs</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=7">7 discs</a> (default)</li>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=8">8 discs</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=9">9 discs</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?numDiscs=10">10 discs</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            The Settings menu is the recommended way to change the number of discs
            during normal classroom use.
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            The <code>numDiscs</code> parameter does not impose a strict upper limit.
            However, because the required number of moves grows exponentially,
            simulations with values far beyond the intended classroom range
            will not complete within a realistic amount of time.
            For example, increasing the disc count by only a few can extend
            the required execution time from minutes to days or longer.
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">
            This behavior can itself serve as a concrete demonstration
            of exponential growth in algorithmic complexity.
